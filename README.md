2. Project Overview
System Architecture
The Expense Tracker is built on a modular architecture that ensures separation of concerns, maintainability, and ease of future enhancement. The main architectural layers and their components include:
  1. Presentation Layer
•	User Interface: Developed with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing, which allows users to interact with the application for logging expenses, viewing reports, and saving expense data. The interface includes fields for entering expense details (description, amount, and category) and options for viewing the expense report.
  2. Business Logic Layer
•	ExpenseTracker Class: This class contains all the business logic related to managing expenses, including adding expenses, updating budgets, and handling expense reports. It also enforces budget constraints for each expense category and alerts users if an expense exceeds the available budget.
•	ReportGenerator Inner Class: Encapsulates the functionality for generating formatted reports, allowing the main ExpenseTracker class to delegate report creation to this inner class, keeping the code organized and modular.
  3. Data Layer
•	Expense Class and Subclasses: Defines the structure of different expense types, such as Food, Travel, and Other expenses, using an abstract Expense class and specific subclasses for each type.
•	File Handling: Manages the reading and writing of expense data to text files for data persistence. Users can save expense reports to a file, allowing easy reference and tracking over time.
Component Interaction
•	Users interact with the Presentation Layer, entering details and managing expenses.
•	The Presentation Layer communicates with the Business Logic Layer to add expenses, display reports, and save data.
•	The Business Logic Layer accesses the Data Layer to store expense details, update budgets, and generate reports, while File Handling ensures data persistence across sessions.

Features
1.	Expense Management: Users can add new expenses by specifying a description, amount, and category (Food, Travel, or Other). Budgets for each category are tracked, and the application notifies users if they exceed the set budget for any category.
2.	Category Management: Users can categorize expenses under predefined categories (Food, Travel, and Other), making it easier to track spending in specific areas and manage budgets.
3.	Report Generation: Users can view a real-time report of all expenses, categorized by type, showing each expense's description, amount, and date. This report is displayed within the application and can be saved as a text file.
4.	Data Persistence: Expense data can be saved to a file, ensuring that users can keep a record of their expenses and access it even after the application session ends.
5.	Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms prevent application crashes due to invalid inputs, such as entering a non-numeric amount or exceeding the category budget.

Modules
1. Expense Module
•	Purpose: Defines the structure and behavior of expenses.
•	Components:
o	Expense (abstract class): A base class defining shared properties (description, amount, date) and an abstract method getCategory() that each subclass must implement.
o	Food, Travel, and Other: Subclasses of Expense that represent specific expense types, each implementing the getCategory() method to return its category name.
2. Budget Module
•	Purpose: Manages budget constraints for each category.
•	Components:
o	Map<String, Double> budgets: A map that holds the budget limits for each category, tracking each category's remaining budget.
o	Budget Checking: Each time an expense is added, the budget for the corresponding category is checked, and users are alerted if their expense exceeds the budgeted amount.
3. Report Generation Module
•	Purpose: Handles the generation and display of expense reports.
•	Components:
o	ReportGenerator Inner Class: Generates formatted reports of expenses, categorized by type. It is implemented as an inner class within ExpenseTracker to encapsulate report-specific logic, keeping it separate from core expense tracking operations.
4. Persistence Module
•	Purpose: Ensures data persistence through file I/O operations.
•	Components:
o	File Handling Methods: Methods for saving expense reports to text files, allowing users to keep a record of their expenses across sessions.


Implementation Details
1. Inheritance and Polymorphism
•	Inheritance: The project uses inheritance by defining an abstract Expense class, with subclasses for each specific expense type (Food, Travel, and Other). The subclasses inherit shared properties and methods from the Expense class, such as description, amount, and date.
•	Polymorphism: Polymorphism is achieved through the getCategory() method. Each subclass of Expense (Food, Travel, Other) implements this method to return its specific category name. This enables the application to treat all expenses as instances of Expense while still categorizing them accurately based on their concrete class type.
2. Inner Classes
•	ReportGenerator: The application uses an inner class, ReportGenerator, within the ExpenseTracker class to handle report generation. This encapsulates the report-specific functionality, keeping it close to where it is used, improving code readability, and making it easy to modify or extend the reporting functionality in the future.
3. Exception Handling
•	Exception Management: The application uses exception handling to prevent crashes and provide user-friendly feedback in the following scenarios:
o	Invalid Input: Catches NumberFormatException if the user enters a non-numeric amount, prompting them to enter a valid number.
o	Budget Overrun Warning: Checks each expense against the category’s remaining budget, alerting users if the expense exceeds the available budget for that category. This ensures users are aware of budget limits, promoting responsible spending.
4. Threading
•	Multithreading: The application employs multithreading to simulate concurrent expense logging. The ExecutorService is used to handle multiple expense additions simultaneously, demonstrating the potential for real-time tracking of expenses from multiple sources. This setup could be beneficial if extended to a more complex application, especially in a future GUI version where simultaneous expense updates could enhance the user experience.
5. Java Collections API
•	Collections: The application uses Java’s Collections API for efficient data management.
o	List<Expense> expenses: Stores all expenses in a thread-safe synchronized list, allowing concurrent access and modification.
o	Map<String, Double> budgets: Maps each category to its budget limit, providing constant-time access for budget checks. This improves efficiency and ensures smooth performance as expenses are added and budgets are updated.
6. File Handling
•	Data Persistence: File handling is implemented to save expense reports to a text file, allowing users to keep a record of their expenses across sessions.
o	Saving Reports: Using BufferedWriter and FileWriter, the application writes the expense report to a text file in a structured format, making it easy for users to review or analyze their past expenses.
•	Report Structure: Each entry in the report file includes details such as the category, description, amount, and date, providing a comprehensive overview of the user’s financial activities.
Overall, these implementation details highlight the use of Java's object-oriented principles and various features to create a functional and efficient banking system.

4. Project Demonstration
Expense Entry
•	Demonstrate Adding an Expense:
o	Users can add a new expense by entering the details in the provided fields in the GUI. To add an expense, they fill out the description, specify the amount, and select a category (e.g., Food, Travel, Other).
•	Expense Details Input:
o	The GUI fields allow users to enter specific details, such as a description (e.g., "Lunch"), the amount (e.g., 20.00), and a category.
o	Once details are entered, clicking on the "Add Expense" button records the expense in the system.
•	Category-Specific Budget Handling:
o	Each category (e.g., Food, Travel) has a predefined budget, and the system checks this budget against the new expense to prevent overspending.
o	If the entered expense exceeds the available budget, a warning message is displayed, alerting users about the budget overrun. This functionality helps users stay within their predefined budgets for each category.
2. Budget Management and Alerts
•	Budget Initialization:
o	Each expense category is associated with an initial budget (e.g., Food: $1000, Travel: $2000). These budgets can be predefined in the system to set limits on spending.
•	Budget Check on Expense Entry:
o	When an expense is added, the system checks the entered amount against the available budget for that category.
o	If adding the expense would exceed the budget, the system displays a warning message to notify the user.
•	Budget Tracking:
o	After each expense, the remaining budget is updated. This allows users to see how much they have left in each category and helps them plan future expenses accordingly.
3. Expense Report Generation
•	Real-Time Report Display:
o	The system generates a report of all expenses in real-time, displaying it in the GUI. The report includes details like the category, description, amount, and date of each expense.
•	Formatted Report Output:
o	The report is presented in a structured format, making it easy to review all expenses by category. This organization helps users understand where most of their spending occurs and assists in tracking daily expenses.
•	Easy Accessibility:
o	The report is accessible within the application, allowing users to quickly view their financial activities without needing to navigate multiple screens or windows.
4. Data Persistence and Report Saving
•	Save Report to File:
o	Users can save their expense report to a text file for long-term record-keeping. Clicking the "Save Report" button prompts the system to write the current report to a file in a readable format.
•	File Structure and Access:
o	The report is saved with a clear structure, including details for each entry such as category, description, amount, and date.
o	Users can access the saved file later to review their expenses even after closing the application, making it a reliable tool for tracking long-term spending.
•	Backup and Retrieval:
o	Saving the report to a file acts as a backup of expenses, ensuring that users do not lose data if the application is restarted or closed.


5. Challenges and Error Handling
Challenges:
1. Budget Management Logic:
Challenge: Ensuring the correct budget is updated after every expense.
Solution: Used Map to manage the budget dynamically for each category.

2. Exception Handling:
Challenge: Managing invalid input formats, such as non-numeric entries.
Solution: Used try-catch blocks to handle NumberFormatException gracefully.

3. File Handling:
Challenge: Ensuring the report file is saved correctly without data loss.
Solution: Used BufferedWriter to ensure efficient and error-free writing.

4. UI Design:
Challenge: Creating a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls.
Solution: Designed a simple GUI using Java Swing with buttons and text areas.

5. Ambiguity with List Import
Issue: Java has both java.util.List and java.awt.List, which led to ambiguous references when importing the List interface.
Solution: Specified the import explicitly as java.util.List to ensure that the correct List type was used for handling expenses.

6. Handling IOException for File Saving:
Issue: Since file operations can throw an IOException, attempting to save reports without proper handling caused compilation errors.
Solution: Added try-catch blocks around file-saving operations to handle IOException gracefully, displaying an error message if the file could not be saved.

7. Handling NumberFormatException for Invalid Amount Input:
Issue: If a user entered non-numeric characters in the "Amount" field, a NumberFormatException would occur, causing the program to crash.
Solution: Wrapped the amount-parsing logic in a try-catch block and displayed an error message to prompt the user for valid numeric input.

8. Ensuring Unique File Creation for Each Session:
Issue: Users wanted each session to save to a unique file to avoid overwriting previous reports.
Solution: Used SimpleDateFormat to generate a unique filename based on the current timestamp, ensuring that each session’s report is saved in a separate file.

9. Budget Overrun Logic in Different Categories:
Issue: Adding an expense that exceeded the predefined budget caused unexpected behavior due to unhandled budget logic.
Solution: Added logic to check if the expense amount exceeded the remaining budget for the category. If it did, a warning message would be shown, and the expense would not be added.

10. User Interface Consistency with Fixed Currency (INR):
Issue: Initially, a currency dropdown allowed both INR and USD, which added complexity with currency conversion logic and user interaction.
Solution: Removed the dropdown to keep INR as the fixed currency, simplifying the interface and eliminating conversion errors.

11. File Naming Consistency and Error Management:
Issue: With dynamically generated filenames, ensuring the filename was valid and consistent across all operating systems was essential to prevent IOException.
Solution: Used only alphanumeric characters and underscores for filenames generated by SimpleDateFormat to ensure compatibility across different OS file systems.


6. Conclusion and Future Work
Conclusion:
The Expense Tracker project successfully demonstrates the use of Java's OOP principles to build a practical financial tracking application. By using inheritance, polymorphism, and inner classes, the project provides a modular structure that can be extended easily. The implementation of exception handling and file management ensures smooth operation and data persistence.

•	Implementation Details:
o	Category-Based Charts:
	Visualize spending per category (e.g., Food, Travel, Other) using pie charts or bar charts. This helps users see at a glance where most of their money is going, making it easy to spot areas for potential savings.
	Use different colors for each category, with tooltips showing details when hovering over segments for a more interactive experience.
o	Time-Based Graphs:
	Implement line or bar graphs to track spending over days, weeks, or months. This allows users to observe trends in their spending behavior over time and identify any unusual spikes in expenses.
	Add filters for daily, weekly, or monthly views to allow users to zoom in on specific periods for more focused analysis.
o	Budget vs. Actual Spending:
	Create graphs that compare actual expenses against set budgets, providing a visual representation of budget adherence. For instance, if a user sets a $1000 monthly budget for travel, a bar chart could display the cumulative expenses in this category relative to the limit.
	Provide alerts or color changes when spending is close to or over the budget to promote mindful spending.
•	Technology Options:
o	Use libraries like JFreeChart or JavaFX for native Java solutions, or explore third-party visualization libraries (like Plotly or Google Charts if using a web-based approach) to implement interactive charts.
4. User Authentication: Secure, Personalized Expense Tracking
•	Objective: Ensure secure access to the Expense Tracker by implementing user login functionality. Authentication allows each user to have a personalized, private expense record that only they can access.
•	Implementation Details:
o	User Registration:
	Introduce a registration screen where new users can create an account by providing a username, password, and possibly email for password recovery.
	Passwords should be hashed before storage for security. Use libraries such as BCrypt to handle password hashing.
o	Login Screen:
	Add a login screen where users enter their username and password. On successful login, the user accesses their unique expense data.
	Implement error handling for incorrect login attempts, with feedback for users to ensure clarity (e.g., "Incorrect username or password").
o	Session Management:
	Once authenticated, manage the user’s session to maintain secure access during their time in the app. Implement session timeouts for idle users to enhance security.
o	Data Segmentation:
	Modify the data structure to support multiple users. This might involve associating each expense entry with a user ID, ensuring that each user only sees their own data.
o	Security Features:
	Use encryption for sensitive data, particularly if storing user credentials or personal finance information.
	Implement regular password change prompts or multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
•	Benefits:
o	Data Privacy: Each user's financial information remains private, which is crucial for security and data integrity.
o	Personalization: Users can create custom budgets, reports, and expense categories, providing a more tailored experience within the app.
